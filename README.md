Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
This project implements a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) model using machine learning techniques. It processes sensor data to classify human activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and running.

Features
Loads and preprocesses time-series sensor data.
Extracts meaningful features for classification.
Trains and evaluates machine learning models.
Provides performance metrics to assess accuracy.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook HumanActivityRecognition.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
Dataset
The dataset used should contain sensor readings such as accelerometer and gyroscope data.
Ensure the dataset is properly formatted before use.
Results
The model's accuracy and classification report will be displayed at the end of the notebook.
Acknowledgments
Data and methodologies are inspired by existing HAR research.
